Shmuel (pseudonym) 22 years old, a discharged soldier working in the field of tourism. Shmuel is the youngest of 4 brothers, all of whom live away from home. His father is a self-employed carpenter, and his mother is a school secretary. Shmuel described a normal developmental background without early traumas. He grew up in a community settlement in the north of the country and was educated in the educational system in the settlement, and in middle school he began studying at the regional school. At the age of 16, Shmuel's mother was diagnosed with cancer and Shmuel supported her and helped her. During his mother's illness, Shmuel decided to move to the south of the country, as part of a project of the kibbutz movement, where he lived in a commune until the end of the 12th grade.

Shmuel shared that it was a turning point in his life, where he opened up to the world and felt that he was able to express himself. In November 2018, he enlisted in the army and served in an infantry brigade as the commander of a platoon of recruits. After 4 months in the post of military commander, a traumatic event occurred, when one of his soldiers went into cardiac arrest and died while he was on vacation at home. Shmuel was responsible for informing his teammates, identifying the body, and taking an active part in his command's funeral.

The trauma story
Shmuel enlisted in November 2018. First he was a soldier in an infantry unit, and later in the service, he went through a military course which was significant for him. In January 2020, during the soldiers' vacation at home, one of his subordinates died of cardiac arrest during his sleep. Shmuel was chosen by the army to identify the body and be responsible for part of the funeral arrangements. Shmuel was in the car with the body before arriving at the cemetery, and during the funeral journey, he was among the coffin bearers. Shmuel shared that already upon identifying the body, and then in the vehicle that carried the body and meeting the family at the cemetery, he was under intense tension and experienced intense physical feelings of anxiety and stress, which were manifested in increased sweating, palpitations and a desire to cry.

Two years and five months later, when he was already a discharged soldier, his former commanders asked him to come to the soldier's family home on Memorial Day. At first he didn't want to go at all, but eventually he did. After that, he began to develop post-traumatic symptoms. That is, Shmuel developed a delayed onset of delayed post-traumatic disorder, and came to treatment about two months after the outbreak and two and seven months after the traumatic event itself. In the PTSD questionnaire (PCL-5) dated 7/6/22 he showed a score of 63 indicating severe symptoms (well beyond the cut-off point for the diagnosis, 28+).

the course of treatment
The treatment was carried out as part of the "Seeing Far" project, and was defined from the beginning as a trauma-focused treatment using the SEE FAR CBT method. The treatment included 17 therapeutic sessions; An hour and a half meeting every week, for 4 months. Shmuel made sure to arrive on time for all meetings and in a continuous and consistent manner without cancellations.

Introduction, recognition and psycho-educational guidance
According to the treatment protocol of SEE FAR CBT, in the first session of the treatment an in-depth intake was carried out in combination with an assessment and diagnosis of PTSD, at this stage Shmuel filled out the PCL-5 questionnaire (score 63). After the intake there was introduction, recognition and psycho-educational training. In the second session, I conducted psychological training for Shmuel on PTSD and the therapeutic approach of SEE FAR CBT and the treatment components. Shmuel received information sheets for the patient about "what is a post-traumatic reaction", and I asked him to write next to each explanation what his personal symptoms are, what he suffers from. Below is the list of symptoms:

• Intrusiveness - Shmuel described anxiety attacks on a daily basis which made it difficult for him to function, great difficulty especially when it got dark, described a huge fear of going to bed because of nightmares. He also described feelings as if the traumatic event was repeatedly experienced as a flashback.

• Considerable concentration difficulties - Shmuel described that the memories are so intrusive and with the feeling that he has no control over them and that he is constantly trying to push them away, as a result he had difficulty following a conversation, reading regularly and remembering small details, Shmuel felt a loss of control over his thoughts.

• Avoidances - Shmuel had a whole list of triggers, so he proactively avoided situations, places and people directly and indirectly related to the trauma.

• Increased arousal - Shmuel described extreme alertness, panic easily, difficulty sleeping, physical tremors, and a constant sense of danger that caused him to be ready in any situation, in a manner consistent with a dangerous situation.

• Emotional injury - Shmuel shared that he has no interest or pleasure in the things he liked to do before the traumatic event. He withdrew from social gatherings and his family. Shmuel also described that he had difficulty feeling feelings of love and affection. felt intense anger at all his loved ones. He also described great feelings of guilt and shame after the traumatic event.

Shmuel described relief after reading the explanatory pages together, mainly around a sense of normalcy, and relief due to the understanding that he is not "crazy". Following the explanation about the SEE FAR CBT treatment method, Shmuel shared that he mainly connects to the work of the body, the memory of the body and experiencing reality, but that he is very afraid of the reconstruction in the fantastic space. I explained to Shmuel about the method of reconstruction in the fantastic space, and presented to him the possibility that imagination can also be the means through which we can reduce the bothersomeness and anxiety of the images that have been running through his imagination since the event.

Creating a treatment contract and determining treatment goals
In the next step of the treatment, there was a mutual agreement between Shmuel and me regarding the necessity of the treatment and the treatment contract was agreed upon. At this stage, after agreeing on the necessity of the treatment, we moved on to clarifying the goals, and together we collected and succinctly summarized the goals of the treatment from the prominent symptoms. The goals were:

• Reducing arousal - identifying the symptoms and triggers he suffers from, and a significant reduction in the number of times he jumps and panics

• Improving the quality of sleep - to help him fall asleep easily and sleep continuously

• Improving the "peace" in his life - to feel that he is able to rest, stay, enjoy things as before

• To return to feeling pleasant sensations - to fall in love, to love, to feel a positive emotion, to return to being interested in the people close to him

• Processing the past trauma - so that it becomes a uniform, continuous memory and without overwhelming emotional reactions
