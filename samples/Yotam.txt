During my session with Yotam, a soldier in the Israeli army, it became evident that he is grappling with severe trauma following a harrowing experience in Gaza. Yotam shared that his team’s tank was hit by an explosive device, leading to the loss of several close friends. This incident has left him deeply shaken and struggling with a complex mix of emotions.

Yotam described the moment of the explosion in vivid detail. He recalled the deafening sound, the blinding light, and the immediate chaos that ensued. The smell of burning metal and the sight of his comrades, some of whom he considered brothers, being grievously injured or killed, haunt him constantly. He mentioned feeling a profound sense of helplessness and guilt for surviving while others did not.

He also shared that since the incident, he has been experiencing recurrent nightmares, flashbacks, and intense feelings of sadness and anger. Yotam mentioned that he finds it challenging to sleep and is often jolted awake by memories of the explosion. During the day, he is easily startled, hyper-vigilant, and avoids anything that reminds him of the event, including loud noises and crowded places. He admitted to withdrawing from friends and family, feeling detached and numb, and struggling to find meaning in activities he once enjoyed.

Yotam’s recounting of these symptoms suggests he is suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance behaviors, hyper-vigilance, and emotional numbness are characteristic of this condition. Additionally, his feelings of survivor’s guilt and profound sadness indicate that he might also be experiencing depression.

It is crucial to provide Yotam with a supportive and structured environment where he can begin to process his trauma. Therapy, particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), could be beneficial in helping him work through his traumatic memories and reduce the intensity of his symptoms. Medication might also be considered to help manage his anxiety and depression. Engaging in support groups with fellow soldiers who have had similar experiences could provide him with a sense of community and understanding, which is essential for his recovery.
